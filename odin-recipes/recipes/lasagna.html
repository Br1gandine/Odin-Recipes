        <h3>How to prepare</h3>

        <ol>
            <p><li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; 
                cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li></p>
            
            <p><li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, 
                basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, 
                stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li></p>
            
            <p><li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet 
                firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li></p>

            <p><li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

            <p><li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, 
                salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li></p>

            <p><li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. 
                Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. 
                Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. 
                Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. 
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li></p>

            <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until 
                cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li></p>

            <p><li>Remove from the oven an let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li></p>
